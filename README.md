# matlab-robot-arm-line-model
This project was made as group. I dont take any credit for overall project. The main script ( trial1 ) will be revized to avoid bugs since not all the gcodes work without error ( the code doesnt cover the gcode reading part though, but when i try, it works until robot arm can not reach a position and throws an error). Robot is modeled according to a pyhsical robotic arm.
